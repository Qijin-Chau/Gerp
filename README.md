# Gerp

Gerp is a C++ program based on the Linux grep command. Gerp takes in user queries and searches for every instance of the string within a directory using a hash table created from a file tree traversal. The project was originally tested with small, medium, and large versions of the Gutenberg library and aimed to minimize memory usage while optimizing speed.
